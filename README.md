# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is a branch of computer sience used for developing, testing and maintaining software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity
mastering process
mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning- identify software requirement
requirement analysis- identify the final user specification
design- build the framework
coding- converting software into tangible form
testing- examine software for any bugs

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Water methodology is linear and sequential for example customer feedback comes later after product is developed while agile methodology is interactive and incremential for example regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- develops applications, programs and systems using programming languages and framework
Quality Assurance Engineer- colllaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify softaware requirements
Project Manager- Assembles and lead the software development team

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments can make suggestionsto complete a code statement when the developer begins typing for example Visual Script Code
Version Control Systems -help software development teams manage changes to source code over time for example Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
rapid technological advancement- adopting continuos  learning practices
Time constraints- adopt agile methodologies
Software security- research ways to protect against hacking and malware

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit-close to the sorce of operation.Ensures each unit perform its intended function
integration-verify that different models work together.Help ensure data flows smoothly
system- focus on entire software system. Helps ensure system meets all requirements
Acceptance- Verifies if a system meets business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it is the process of guiding generative AI solutios to generate desired outputs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Draw a picture of a person
improved prompt- draw a picture of a girl with brown hair, a red dress and brown shoes standing in a field with trees and grass
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific and concise
